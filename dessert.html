            <h2>Red Velvet Cake</h2>
                <p>On a seemingly normal day my Dad brought home a slice of Red Velvet Cake from work. He said a woman at his office made it because she was leaving and my Dad was excited to try it because she used to bake cakes professionally as a side job during the holidays. When my family and I tasted it my life was forever changed. I asked my Dad to please ask her for the recipe. She gave it to him and told him not to share it with anyone else, it was a family recipe. So every year since I was 11, I now bake this cake at christmans and my family and I look forward to it every year.</p>

            <h2>Banana Pudding</h2>
                <p>One day after work I mat up with some girlfriends at <em>Voodoo Bayou</em>, I had never been there before and they didn't have a lot of options for me as I am a vegetarian. So, what is always vegetarian? Dessert. I ordered dessert for dinner and I was happy I did. All my friends at the table tasted it too and said it was the best banana pudding they have ever had. The menu descibles it as: vanilla wafers, banana creme chantilly, and carmel but it is more than that, it is heaven.</p>

            <h2>La Gringuita Cookies</h2>
                <p>These cookies are mindblowingly delicious, and I am not just saying that because I have been friends with the owner since we were 9! My friend Caroline has always been a foodie and always loved to bake growing up. A couple of years ago, she lived in Uruguay and started baking and selling cookies as a side business. As she refined her craft, she moved back to the U.S. due to COVID-19. While back home, she decided to fully launch her cookie business. She has absolutely amazing flavors, and it is so inspiring to see a close friend launch and work so hard at her passion. I always look forward to having these cookies because I know how much love they are made with.

            <h2>Croissants</h2>
                <p>Buttery. Flaky. Plain? Chocolate? Almond? The list can go on and on. Croissants are acceptable to eat anytime of the day and in any form, like a sandwhich. What is not to love about croissants? </p>

            <h2>Ice Cream</h2>
                <p>I have always enjoyed ice cream. I have even enjoyed it  outside while snowing! Growing up in Florida it was always a treat to go get Palm Beach Ice Cream on hot summer nights. My love for ice cream has only grown since then with the exploration of the many flavor combinations. Recently, I have been enjoying <em>Van Leeuwen</em>Earl Grey Tea Ice Cream, which you can conviently buy at most grocery stores! I am a big fan of earl grey, so to see it in an ice cream I knew I had to try it and clearly I love it because I am writing about it. Live, Laugh, Love: Ice Cream.</p>
