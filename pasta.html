            <h2> 5. Indoroni (Grown-Up Mac-n-Cheese)</h2>
                <p>If you are a mac-n-cheese lover then this is the pasta for you. It's cheesy. It's spicy. It's rich. Chicken is optional! It's from a place called <em>Little Moir's Leftovers</em>, which offers a wide array of American food but with a twist. This place is worth every penny and my family and I come here at least once a month.</p>

            <h2> 4. Pear Fiocchi</h2>
                <p>So there is a funny little story behind this dish. First, it is from <em>Carmine's Coal Fired Pizza</em>. My family is Italian and eats Italian all the time. It got to the point where my parents were going to this restaurant so much that I did not want to come along because I felt like I was overdoing Italian food. So I and Carmine took a break. Sometimes passes and along comes my Dad's birthday. He's a simple man so where do you think he wants to go for his birthday dinner? Carmines! My sister and I went a bit unenthused. To our surprise though, they had a new specials menu in which this dish piqued my interest: a creamy sauce with sun-dried tomatoes, sage, and pasta filled with pears. I got it and that's the story of how I fell back in love with Carmine. I love those pear pillows.</p>

            <h2> 3. Red Bell Pepper Pasta Sauce With Cavatappi</h2>
                <p>This pasta dish actually came into my life quite recently and blew my taste buds away. One of the best parts about it is...my Dad made it (who is in the background)! He frequently gets his recipes from YouTube and came across Not Another Cooking Show's channel and thought this dish looked interesting. It will now be a staple sauce in my life. It's unique, sweet, spicy, cheesy, and 100% delicious.

            <h2> 2. Pasta Al Limone</h2>
                <p>This is a simple pasta but it is quite amazing. It's from a restaurant called <em>Lynora's</em>. I do not even want to know how much butter is in this dish but it's buttery and lemony and I am happy to have eaten it in my life.</p>

            <h2> 1. Pappardelle Al Telefono Alla Bice</h2>
                <p>Now now now. We are at the final pasta! This dish is from <em>Bice</em> in Palm Beach. It's not just pasta, it's a whole experience. I am someone who enjoys nice dinners and Palm Beach is the place for that. I have been getting this dish for years it's large noodles in a tomato cream sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil. It is seriously so good. The fresh pasta is perfectly al dente, the sauce is the perfect balance of red and cream, and when you lift a noodle you get a beautiful cheese pull. I hope you will get to experience this dish as well someday. *chef's kiss*</p>
